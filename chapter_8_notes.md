## Modules
- Write Python program in a **file** for execution, the file is also called as **script**.
- **module**: a file containing Python code that can be imported and used by scripts, other modules, or the interactive interpreter
- If if `__name__ == "__main__"` is true, then the file is being executed as a script and the branch is taken. Otherwise, the file was imported and thus `__name__` is equal to the module name
- Demos
