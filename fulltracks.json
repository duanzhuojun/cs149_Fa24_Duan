The track gained further momentum when Mercedes AMG used it to promote their Formula One season, followed by its inclusion in an NBA broadcast, solidifying its cultural impact. These moments helped \u201csquabble up\u201d go viral on TikTok, with fans eagerly demanding its release. The track finally dropped on November 22, 2024, as part of Lamar\u2019s surprise album GNX, much to the delight of his audience.\n\nThe accompanying music video, released on November 25, 2024, enhances the song\u2019s gritty, party-ready atmosphere with visuals that are a clear homage to Lamar\u2019s West Coast heritage. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/squabble+up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The game is played by doing the aforementioned chant and one player will say a random number to represent an apartment floor. Each hand on the bottom will go up until you reach the number said and the hand on top will have to take a shot.\n\nOn October 17th, both ROS\u00c9 and Bruno posted pictures with each other to their Instagram accounts, speculating a possible collab. After a comment posted by Bruno was put under ROS\u00c9\u2019s post, the single was first-handedly teased once the singer replied with the following:\n\n\"im gonna kill u. take that back or im not releasing the song bruno. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\"\n\nThe collaboration was then officially announced by both artists just a few moments later. Prior to the public\u2019s first sighting of the duo, ROS\u00c9 was known to be a fan of Bruno after attending one of his concerts held in Seoul and Los Angeles.\n\nThe duo experiments with a playful pop rock instrumental, accompanied by lovey lyrics that describe the desire for someone, inviting them for a wild time at the titular apartment (of which \u201cAPT.\u201d is an abbreviation). ROS\u00c9 and Bruno\u2019s powerful vocals complement the fun groovy track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ros%C3%A9/_/APT.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "content": "\"Please Please Please\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sabrina Carpenter. It was released on June 6, 2024, through Island Records, as the second single from her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet. Produced by Jack Antonoff, the pop ballad contains musical influences of disco, country, and yacht rock; lyrically, the singer instructs her boyfriend not to blunder and blemish her reputation.\n\nAn instant commercial success, the song debuted at number one in Ireland, becoming Carpenter's second consecutive chart-topping single in that country, and has also reached the top ten in Australia, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the commercial success of \"Espresso\", the singer announced her upcoming sixth studio album Short n' Sweet on June 3, 2024. She simultaneously promised an upcoming surprise for her fans, which would turn out to be the single. Only two days later, Carpenter took to social media to announce the song's release and share a teaser of the accompanying music video featuring cinematic visuals set to showcase her acting skills. The clip shows her wearing a lacy red outfit in a robbery-like setting, as well as engaging in a romance with a criminal played by her real-life boyfriend Barry Keoghan.\n\nThe music video for \"Please Please Please\" serves as a sequel to the \"Espresso\" music video released earlier in 2024. In the music video for \"Espresso\", Carpenter gets arrested at the end. \u201cI ended the last video getting arrested, so naturally I thought it would be satisfying to start the \u2018Please Please Please\u2019 video in jail,\u201d said the singer. \u201cI liked the idea of falling in love with a convict and being shocked and embarrassed every time he commits crimes. I was sooo lucky to get Barry Keoghan in the video \u2019cause he is just magic on screen.\u201d said the singer after the music video was released. The Irish actor is rumored to be Carpenter's off-screen boyfriend after they started being seen together in December 2023 and throughout 2024.\n\nBardia Zeinali, the music video director, commented about the inspiration for the music video to GQ. \"The concept was pretty collaborative. I had a brief from Sabrina's team \u2013 they wanted it to pick up from where \u201cEspresso\u201d left off and they wanted it to be about this person that Sabrina's character keeps falling for, that has this chaotic behaviour. So I just elaborated on that and started to think a bit more about specifically what happens. I liked this idea of there being a role reversal and an exchange of power towards the end. And things that were recurring, like her picking him up in the same place, same location, different day, different time.\", said the director to GQ. \"Pam and Tommy. Madonna and Dennis Rodman. Tarantino was a big reference point. Natural Born Killers. Bonnie and Clyde, obviously. Even Thelma & Louise. We were really looking at film references more than anything else and pop culture references in terms of what we wanted the spirit of this moment to be. Even J Lo and Ben Affleck \u2013 not to reference, but to capture that spirit. It's similar in the sense that they're this really exciting young couple, both having big moments in their respective careers, coming together and making a piece of art. But this is very much not real life \u2013 it's a story,\" said the director. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Carpenter/_/Please+Please+Please\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Billie was to add further fuel to the speculation via her Instagram story; entertaining the potential of her being featured on the remix, with a question mark on her face, once again cheekily jabbing at the audience with the \u2018guessing\u2019 symbol.\n\nA day later, on August 1st, it was confirmed by Charli that Billie was the one collaborating on the track. Charli also revealed the existence of a music video coinciding with the remix that would be released at 6pm EST on the same day. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/_/guess+featuring+billie+eilish\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the lyrics, Billie reflects on the emotional weight of a previous relationship and wonders how much of it still lingers in her partner\u2019s heart.\n\nKey themes include heartbreak, jealousy, and vulnerability, as Billie questions whether she has crossed emotional lines and if her partner is also grappling with memories of their ex. The imagery in the song, such as \u201cburning like a fever\u201d and \u201ccrying on Valentine\u2019s Day in a hotel,\u201d evokes a sense of both physical and emotional intensity, highlighting the pain and guilt associated with these unspoken feelings.\n\nWhile it touches on personal insecurity, it is also a reflection on how past loves can quietly overshadow current relationships. Fans have connected the lyrics to Billie\u2019s rumored relationships, making this one of the more candid and raw tracks from the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/_/Wildflower\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The video\u2019s set is an identical set to the teaser for \u201cWHAT\u2019S GOOD\u201d. It plays out as a musical audition on a daytime TV show gone wrong. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross stars in the video. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tyler,+the+Creator/_/Earfquake\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I guess that\u2019s why she decided that we could kiss, but only for a little bit and then she would go to sleep and I would have to leave. And that\u2019s what happened. Afterwards, I quickly discovered that this isolated incident had not changed the situation between us and I shrugged and gave up again.\n\nThen, later, I was at her house and we got around to talking about writing songs. She asked if I\u2019d ever written a song about her. Anyways, I told her I had just written a song about her called Lovers Rock. This was before the song was released but I played her a demo of it from my phone. It was sort of strange. I remember I was lying on her couch with my head in her lap and she was playing with my hair, and we just sat there and listened to the whole song in silence. When it was over I looked up at her and she said \u201cI really like that one.\u201d That was all.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/TV+Girl/_/Lovers+Rock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She realizes this isn't a wise plan and is struggling to accept that the relationship may not have been meant to be and has reached a point of no return. Ultimately, her angry feelings power her to a place of acceptance and she's able to find closure in the knowledge that at least she put forth her best effort.\n\nThe song gets its title from Kill Bill (2003\u20132004), a martial arts film duology that focuses on an assassin named the Bride and her quest to exact revenge on her ex-boyfriend through murder. Mirroring the films' plot, the song's lyrics discuss SZA's fantasy to kill an ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend out of jealousy. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/SZA/_/Kill+Bill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
