### Mini lectures/Demos
#### In Python, the print() function is used to output data to the console. There are several ways to use print() depending on what you want to achieve.
1. Basic way
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")   #output is Hello, World!
   
   name = "cs149"
   print("This is", name)   #output is This is cs149
   ```

2. Keeping output on the same line by 'end'
   ```python
   print("Hello", end=", ")
   print("World!")

   # output is Hello, World
   ```

3. Escape characters in Python are used to represent certain special characters within a string. They are introduced with a backslash (```\```).
   Here’s a list of common escape characters in Python and their meanings:
   1. Newline (```\n```)
      ```python
      print("Hello\nWorld!")
      ```
      Output is
      ```python
      Hello
      World!
      ```
   2. Tab (`\t`): Inserts a horizontal tab (equivalent to pressing the Tab key).
      ```python
      print("Hello\tWorld!")
      ```
      ```python
      Hello   World!
      ```
