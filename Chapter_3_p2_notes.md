## Boolean expressions

### Relational Operators:

2. ```!=```(Not equal)
3. ```> ```(Greater than)
4. ```<``` (Less than)
5. ```>=``` (Greater than or equal to)
6. ```<= ```(Less than or equal to)

### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```
